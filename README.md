## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Node, MongoDB and Express.

My learning was focused on the manipulation of express and connecting my database with CRUD capabilities. 

## Optimizations

It would have been nice to be able to get mutlitple quotes to loop through to generate more quotes. 

## Lessons Learned:

CRUD application can be troublesome if the password is not properly embedded into the url <password>.
