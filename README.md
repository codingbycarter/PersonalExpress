A Star Wars quote generator Application. This app has several features including a Darth Vader and Yoda quotes, with post, delete and update capabilities.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Node, MongoDB and Express.

My learning was focused on the manipulation of express and connecting my database with CRUD capabilities.
